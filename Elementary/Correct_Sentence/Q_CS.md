# Correct Sentence
## English
For the input of your function will be given one sentence. You have to return its fixed copy in a way so itâ€™s always starts with a capital letter and ends with a dot.

Pay attention to the fact that not all of the fixes is necessary. If a sentence already ends with a dot then adding another one will be a mistake.

*Input*: A string.

*Output*: A string.

*Example*:
```
correct_sentence("greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
correct_sentence("Greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
correct_sentence("Greetings, friends.") == "Greetings, friends."
```
